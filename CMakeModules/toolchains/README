This directory contains toolchain files for cross-compiling with CMake.


Usage Instructions
------------------
Pass the path to the toolchain file in the variable CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE when calling CMake.

For example, if we're building mstdlib, and targeting Windows 64-bit from Cygwin:
   ~/mstdlib/                        - root source directory
   ~/mstdlib/CMakeModules/toolchains - toolchains directory
   ~/mstdlib/build64                 - build directory

You'd call CMake from the build directory like this:
   $> cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../CMakeModules/toolchains/cygwin-win-64 ..


Naming Conventions
------------------
Try to keep toolchain file names concise, and easy to remember.

Suggested naming pattern: [host os]-[target os]-[arch]

   host os  = {cygwin,win,linux,mac}

   taget os = {cygwin,win,linux,mac,ios,android}

   arch=32    --> x86
   arch=64    --> x86_64
   arch=arm32 --> 32-bit arm
   arch=arm64 --> 64-bit arm

   etc.
